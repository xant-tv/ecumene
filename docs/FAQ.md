# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I add Ecumene to my server?
Ecumene is currently in private preview. 

For early access:
 - Contact the developer through any linked socials.
 - Join the [Atraxia clan Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/atraxia) and inquire there.

## How do I remove Ecumene from my server?
Boot the bot and delete the associated `Amiable` role.

## How does this bot work?
The setup process requires a Destiny clan owner to register with Ecumene in such a way that the bot can later assume that identity. This allows Ecumene to *act* on behalf of the registered owner when performing clan management tasks.

The safest way to do this if you do not wish to involve your personal Bungie login is to create a new service account and promote that to clan founder.

## What do you do with my user data?
Absolutely nothing. :unamused:

Ecumene requires users to link their Bungie and Discord accounts in the same vein as other popular tools like Charlemagne. It cannot and does not have the ability to obtain any passwords, credentials nor interact with your in-game items.
